# Projects Manager API

Projects Manager is an api that has an authentication system, in which it has registration, confirmation, password recovery and login by saving a JWT in a cookie, once registered the user can manage their projects and project tasks through of CRUD operations. It also has a collaborator system in which a user can see a project that is not a creator but is a collaborator, which allows them to see the tasks equally but can only complete them, but cannot edit or update tasks and projects. Finally, the api has a project search engine which has validations in which a user can only search for projects created by him or projects where he is a collaborator.
